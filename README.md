# UBC Stats Companion

UBC Stats Companion is a Chrome extension that lets UBC students access course statistics from UBC Grades and professor ratings from RateMyProfessors instantly with a simple click.

When the user clicks on the extension on a valid page, the extension fetches the course's data using UBC Grades' API. For professor statistics, web scraping is used to extract the professor's statistics from their page on RateMyProfessors.
